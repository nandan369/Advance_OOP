1. What is the difference between a local repository, and a remote repository
-> Local repository : It's used by a single user and kept on a local device, like a computer. 
   Users work on their projects and make modifications in local repositories.
   Remote repositories: shared by several people and kept in a remote location, like a server. 
   Users can work together by fetching and submitting code updates from remote repositories. (git push and git pull)
   
2. Explain the three states of a file in git: modified, staged, and committed
-> modified state: when we do some changes and save a file but not commit those changes then that file will stays in modified state.
   Staged state: When changes to files are held before they are committed to the local repository then that files statys in staged state. (git add)
   Commited state: when changes are recored to the local repositories then those changes stays in commited state. (git commit)
  
3. What is a “merge conflict”?
-> If the same code is Simultaneously changed by 2 or more developer with different branches and tries for mearge then mearge confilit will occure. 
   Also if file is deleted by one developer while other developer is modifiying that file merge confilit can occure.
   
4. What command would I use to skip the staging step and commit all modified and deleted files 
-> git commit -a -m "Your commit message"
